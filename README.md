# meowto

[meowto](http://meowni.ca/meowto) is a client-side URL shortener because ain't nobody got time for bookmarks. Also, typing `meowto email` just looks cooler than typing a URL, and that's really all that matters. 

The aliases live in your browser's `localStorage`, which is neat because you don't have to worry about your "Steve Buscemi 4 lyfe" fanpage living on a server for people (hint: me) to see. 

Ok, go play with [it](http://meowni.ca/meowto) now. 

## Setup
Bookmark `http://meowni.ca/meowto/?%s`, and add a keyword to turn it into a custom search. I've used `meowto` as my keyword, but you obviously don't have to.

## Sample use
In your browser search bar, type:
  - `meowto add em -> gmail.com` -- aliases `gmail.com` to `em`
  - `meowto em` -- navigates to gmail.com
  - `meowto nuke em` -- deletes the `em` alias
  - `meowto list` -- shows all existing aliases
  - `meowto help` -- prints the available commands
